What is ``termscraper``?
------------------------

It's an in memory VTXXX-compatible terminal emulator.
*XXX* stands for a series of video terminals, developed by
`DEC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation>`_ between
1970 and 1995. The first, and probably the most famous one, was VT100
terminal, which is now a de-facto standard for all virtual terminal
emulators.

``termscraper`` follows the suit. It is a direct fork of
`pyte 0.8.1 <http://github.com/selectel/pyte>`_ which in turn it
is a fork of `vt102 <http://github.com/samfoo/vt102>`_.

``termscraper`` aims to be used mostly for scraping terminal
apps like ``htop`` or very long logs from ``tail`` or ``less``
so it may not support all the features that a full VT100 terminal
would have.


Installation
------------

If you have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_ you can do the usual::

    pip install termscraper

Otherwise, download the source from `GitHub <https://github.com/byexamples/termscraper>`_
and run::

    python setup.py install
